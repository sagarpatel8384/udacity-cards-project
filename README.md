# udacity-cards-project
My submission of the React-Native Udacity Cards Project for Udacity. This application was tested using the Expo iOS simulator, and was not optimized for Android.

## Setup
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Description
This application was built with React-Native. It is a simple Quiz application that allows the user to create an index-card like deck filled with question/answer cards to quiz themselves. The user can run a quiz and receive a score based on their correct answers.
